3. Put in the sugar and salt and mix thoroughly
4. Add the olive oil and mix thoroughly
5. Begin adding the warm water and mix it up with a spatula at the same time till all the water has been engrossed. Then continue by hand till even soft dough is achieved. Fold up the dough and lay it in the bowl.

### Instructions

2. Sprinkle some flour on it; ensure that the flour covers all the margarine. When done, pour out the excess flour.

## Continue with the Pizza dough 
### Instructions
7. After an hour, bring out the pizza dough from the warm place. The pizza dough will look swollen.
8. Knead it for a bit and move it to the oven tray.
9. In a circular motion, spread the dough until it is 12 inches in diameter. The dough may resist as you do this but continue you can get the dough to spread as wide as possible.
10. Cover the dough and place it in a warm place to rise yet again for 45 minutes.

## Prepare the Pizza toppings
### Instructions 
1. While waiting for the Pizza dough to rise a second time, go on and wash the vegetables used for the pizza topping, slice them, and set aside
2. Fry the minced beef in a small quantity of vegetable oil until it turns pale.
3. Get the tomato sauce ready for the pizza. Here we made use of stock cube, onion powder salt, and some Tomato stews i.e. fresh tomato puree fried in vegetable oil. Add the stock cube, onion powder, and salt to the vegetable oil. You can also add any ingredient of your choice.

## Back to the Pizza dough
### Instructions

2. Spread some more olive oil on the dough.
3. Add the tomato sauce.
